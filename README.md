4: Follow the link or go to localhost:5000 in your browser.

This will take you to the proposed website. To use the facial recognition feature, you must first upload an image of the face you wish to add to the database, the image must be in the following format: "FirstName LastName.jpg"
You must then return to the main page and run the encoding process, after which you can begin capture. To stop capture, repeatedly press the "q" key on your keyboard. 
The name of all attendees should now be displayed, and you can additionally download a list of attendees in a .csv file format.
